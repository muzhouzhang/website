I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Essex, where I do research on environmental politics along various lines. Some of my current projects study (1) the nexus between distributive concerns and climate/energy policy preferences, (2) the interplay between the uneven distribution of environmental (climate) hazards and political behaviors, and (3) the preference updating when individuals are cross-pressured by (1) and (2) at the same time.
<br /><br />
Beginning in November 2023 I will be a postdoctoral researcher based at Aarhus University to work on the POLABROAD project.

Please feel free to reach out to me.
