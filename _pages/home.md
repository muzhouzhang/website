<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Essex, where I do research on environmental politics along various lines. Some of my current projects study how people's climate/energy policy preferences are influenced by (1) distributional concerns, (2) the uneven distribution of climate hazards, and (3) the cross-pressure from (1) and (2) at the same time.
<br /><br /> 
I will join the POLABROAD project based at Aarhus University as a postdoctoral researcher, beginning in November.
<br /><br />
Please feel free to reach out to me.
