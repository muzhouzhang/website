With a research agenda in environmental politics, I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Essex, where I also earned a MRes with Distinction in 2020. My current projects unfold along distributional lines. Specifically, I study (1) the nexus between distributive concerns and climate policy preferences, (2) the interplay between the uneven distribution of environmental (climate) hazards and political behavior, and (3) the preference updating when individuals are cross-pressured by distributive climate policies and distributional climate hazards at the same time.

One of my research papers has been published in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2023.2200653" target="_blank"><i>Environmental Politics</i></a>.  
<br /><br />
I am a member of the Centre for Social and Economic Network Analysis (SENA) and a Q-Step Assistant Lecturer.
