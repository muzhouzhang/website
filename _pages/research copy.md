6\. "Path Interdependence and Persistent Fossil Fuel Subsisides" _under review_
<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;">abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify">
> Why do countries worldwide still heavily subsidize fossil fuels despite the accelerating threat of climate change? While most answers so far are exclusively about the domestic complications, I argue that the slow-paced phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies is partly caused by path interdependence, by which countries follow one another too often to move sluggishly, to do nothing, and even to roll back. Underpinning this contagious climate inaction is bounded rationality and risk aversion, with indecisive policy makers turning to their counterparts elsewhere when facing the high-stakes subsidy reform. In particular, this regressive policy emulation asserts more influence between the neighboring or linguistically proximate countries owing to the heuristics that bias people in searching and utilizing information from overseas. Using the data from 29 OECD countries over the past three decades on revising the gasoline tax&mdash;a direct measure to end the most common implicit subsidy regime for fossil fuels, spatial econometric analysis lends strong and robust support to my argument. Beyond climate and energy politics, my research also sheds light on the broad literature of diffusion and the political economy of subsidies in general.

5\. "Supporting Environmental Protection When You Can Afford It" (with Tobias Böhmelt) _under review_
<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;">abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Individuals’ political orientation is among the most robust determinants of environmental beliefs, with people holding left-wing views being generally more in favor of "green" policies. We explore the scope conditions of this effect, focusing on personal economic circumstances. Distinguishing between willingness and opportunity factors, it is argued that the positive effect of left-wing ideology on public support for environmental protection is more strongly pronounced when individuals can actually afford to pay for it. We test the theory using the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES): the analyses provide strong and robust evidence in line with our expectations. This research adds to our understanding of the role of political ideology and economic conditions in environmental public-opinion formation, we shed light on the interactive influence of self-interest and political predisposition in this context, and there are implications for the debate surrounding the environmental Kuznets curve.

4\. "Trade, Free Riding, and Government Underspending on Environmental Innovation" _under review_
<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;">abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify">
How does trade affect the making and implementation of environmental policies? I extend our understanding about this broad research question with an understudied case: government support for environmental innovation. As the foremost channel wherein the cross-border technology transfer occurs, trade materializes the positive externality of technology investment. With that in mind, countries may tend to strategically underfund environmental technologies&mdash;particularly when their trade partners enlarge that spending&mdash;to have more money to use otherwise and to avoid politically awkward innovation failures. To substantiate this crowding out argument, I perform spatial regression with data from 32 OECD countries, 1982&ndash;2017, and find that government spending on environmental R&D in one country is negatively correlated with that of the country's trade partners in environmental goods. My research contributes to the literature by adding new to our understanding about the international trade-environmental policy nexus, depicting a new scenario wherein states underprovide global public goods, and showing the strategic calculus underlying the use of technology-push strategy in addressing climate change.

3\. "Good for the Economy, Good for the Planet? How Foreign Direct Investment Affects Protected Areas" (with Ana Carolina Garriga) _working paper_
<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;">abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Despite a growing literature analyzing the effects of globalization on the environment, we know little about how economic openness affects biodiversity. This paper focuses on the incentives that foreign direct investment (FDI) poses on governments’ foremost strategy to protect biodiversity: the establishment of protected areas. Protected areas have expanded in most countries, but they have done so at varying rates, which is not explained merely by geography or development. We argue that FDI is positively associated with the existence and expansion of protected areas through two channels. First, countries use protected areas to attract and protect extant FDI because multinational corporations can obtain reputational benefits from host countries’ commitment to environmental norms (reputational mechanism). Second, the establishment of protected areas rarely entails expropriation of extant investment. Thus, new protected areas potentially shield current investment from domestic or international competition for the use of comparable land or resources. Our argument, although consistent with the <em>California effect</em> expectations, differs in the logic driving this effect, and on the non-linear expectation of the effect. Panel data analyses on a sample of 60 developed and developing countries strongly support our expectations. Our findings shed new light on globalization’s non-economic implications and adds to our understanding about how international factors influence the provision of public goods.
